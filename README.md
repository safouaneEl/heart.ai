# 🫀 AI Assistant for Heart Disease Prediction

This project is a simple AI-powered assistant built to help doctors make **heart disease predictions**.  
It combines a machine learning model with a Flask web application, providing each doctor with their own private workspace.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project was *vibe coded* and is far from production-ready.  
It’s more of a learning/experimental build than something I’m proud to deploy in a real hospital.
